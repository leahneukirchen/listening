LISTENING(1)                General Commands Manual               LISTENING(1)

NAME
     listening – check if a TCP server is listening

SYNOPSIS
     listening [-t connect-timeout] [-w wait-timeout] [host:]port

DESCRIPTION
     The listening utility performs a TCP scan against the given host
     (defaulting to localhost) and port.

     This can be used to detect if a slowly starting service is ready to
     accept connections.

     The options are as follows:

     -t connect-timeout
             Wait at most connect-timeout seconds per connection attempt
             (default: 0.2s, decimal fractions are allowed).

     -w wait-timeout
             Wait at most wait-timeout seconds total (decimal fractions are
             allowed), and keep trying to connecting when connection has been
             refused.

DETAILS
     listening implements a TCP SYN scan (half-open scan), which has several
     benefits:

     •   As the target program does not accept(2) the connection, there's no
         trace of testing.

     •   It's possible to do in unprivileged Linux userspace, thanks to
         TCP_QUICKACK and SO_LINGER (but also Linux specific).

     Note that firewalls may block this kind of scan, so for reliable results
     listening should be used on localhost only or within a DMZ.

EXIT STATUS
     listening returns one of the following status codes:

     0       when the port is up
     1       when the port refuses connection
     2       when timeout was reached
     99      if some other error occurred
